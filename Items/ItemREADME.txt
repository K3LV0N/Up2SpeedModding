Hello again!

This here is the items folder where you will find all the physical aspects of items
(projectiles from items are in the projectiles folder!)

To create an item, we first must make a [INSERT_COOL_NAME_HERE].cs file.
Once we have done this, we can start to edit the file to create our awesome item!

You also HAVE to (the mod won't work if you don't have this!!!) add a picture of your item.

The name of the picture file will be [INSERT_COOL_NAME_HERE].png. Yes, the names of the files
must be the same!
