Hello all!

This mod is designed to help fledging modders get off the ground and start to create
the content you want to implement!

However, this is not an all-in-one guide. This guide assumes you know the basics of coding
(specifically C#, however if you know other languages then it should be easy to pick up! AKA
feel free to dive in and learn the syntax as you go).

In this guide you will see basic implementations of weapons (melee and ranged, and some summons),
projectiles (ammo and the ranged aspect of the weapons), mining tools (picks, axes, hammers), and
NPCs (townsfolk, enemies and a boss!)

*** CURRENTLY HAS 1 ITEM (FUNCTIONS AS PICK, AXE, HAMMER, MELEE), AND 1 ENEMY ***

I hope this helps you create you own mod in the future!

I hereby give the right to anyone to use, modify, and distribute any parts of this mod.
